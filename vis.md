## Glutamate Receptor Expression in Multiple Sclerosis Patients:

I am assisting in a long-examining the differential expression of the Grin1 and Grin2C subunits of the NMDA receptor in post-mortem human brain samples of white matter plaques versus non-diseased samples. I have been optimizing the immunohistochemistry and RNAscope protocols. 

## Carbon Nanocomposites

And of course some text, and maybe [a link to https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/](https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/)

## Or some code?

Some code might go here:

```
x <- 5 # Here's some R code
```

What if I just paste the HTML for a plotly plot?

We can do it with a line of markdown that looks like this (without the slashes - I haven't solved that problem just yet...):
```
\{\% include jupyter-basic_bar.html \%\}
```
{% include jupyter-basic_bar.html %}
