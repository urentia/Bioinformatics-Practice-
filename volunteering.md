## International Rescue Committee
I am currently a volunteer with the IRC. I help faciliate the first meeting between a new refugee family and their host family. 

## Children's National

I am a member of the Patient Care Volunteer Program. I interact with children of all ages and make them and their families as comfortable as possible.

## LIFE Publicist and Operation Communications
In highscool, I worked with children with special needs. This involved science projects, playign hangman, and anything inbetween.
