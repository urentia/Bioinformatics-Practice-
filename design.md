## Glutamate Receptor Expression in Multiple Sclerosis Patients:

I am assisting in a long-examining the differential expression of the Grin1 and Grin2C subunits of the NMDA receptor in post-mortem human brain samples of white matter plaques versus non-diseased samples. I have been optimizing the immunohistochemistry and RNAscope protocols. 

## Adsorption Of Common Water Pollutants By Magnetite-Activated Carbon Nanocomposites

Magnetite-Activated Carbon (MAC) nanocomposites are a new, reusable compound able to adsorb metals onto its surface, making it able to remove harmful pollutants from water. Mixing MAC nanocomposites with metallic solutions allows for aqueous metal ions to be adsorbed, giving them application in the field of water treatment. The particle size and relative composition of MAC nanocomposites are known to affect it adsorption capabilities. In this experiment, my partner and I tested how manipulating the amount of activated charcoal used during the MAC nanocomposite synthesis influenced its total metal adsorption capacity.
