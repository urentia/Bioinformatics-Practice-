I am a sophomore at George Washington University majoring in Public Health and minoring in Bioinformatics. I currently conduct research at a Neural Development Lab at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. You can also find scribing for George Washington's Medical Faculty Association. In the future, I hope to conduct high impact research on autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and lupus, as well as oncofertility and endometriosis. I love learning and hope to expand my repertoire of technical skills. <br/> 

Here is a list of my current and past coursework: <br/> 

* Introduction to Bioinformatics
* Physics I (with lab)
* Biochemistry 
* Organic Chemistry Lab I and II (with lab)
* Developmental Biology 
* Cell Biology
* Chemical Analysis Senior Research (high school)
